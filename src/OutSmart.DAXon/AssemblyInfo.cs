// reach past that line on purpose: the HTML front end drives the tree builder directly,
// and the test projects exercise engine internals that no host is meant to touch.

// No [assembly: CLSCompliant(true)], and that is a decision, not an oversight: with it the
// compiler reports 116 violations (104 CS3005 case-colliding identifiers, 8 CS3008 leading
// underscores, 4 CS3026 volatile fields). Every CS3005 involves a PROTECTED member, which no
// case-insensitive binder ever sees; probe 31 covers the public pairs, which are the ones that
// broke PowerShell. Closed as not fixing - reasoning in docs/known-gaps.md §surface.
